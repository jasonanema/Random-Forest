# Random-Forest

This repository contains python code for a decision tree and a random forest classifier which I wrote from scratch as a project in a Data Mining course I took at UIUC in Fall 2017 (CS 412). I wrote these to work on the type of data sets that are shared in this file (note that there are both testing and training data sets for each).

Used Python version 2.7.6 and only used built-in libraries (datetime, random, sys).

Read report.pdf for details, such as: Brief introduction to classification methods and classification framework Model Evaluation Measures Parameters chosen during implementation and why Conclusion on whether ensemble method improves performance of the basic classification method you chose, why or why no

You can run either decision tree or random forest on the various sets of data with one of:

python RandomForest.py train_file test_file OR python DecisionTree.py train_file test_file

The data sets are all JSON format were Each line contains an instance and is ended by a '\n' character. <label> is an integer indicating the class label. The pair <index>: <value> gives a feature (attribute) value: <index> is a nonÂ­negative integer and <value> is a number (we only consider categorical attributes). Note that one attribute may have more than 2 possible values, meaning it is a multi-value categorical attribute.
