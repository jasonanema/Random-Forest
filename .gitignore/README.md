# Random-Forest
This repository contains python code for a decision tree and a random forest classifier which I wrote from scratch as a project
in a Data Mining course I took at UIUC in Fall 2017 (CS 412). I wrote these to work on the type of data sets that are shared in this file
(note that there are both testing and training data sets for each).

Used Python version 2.7.6 and only used built-in libraries (datetime, random, sys).

Read report.pdf for details, such as:
  Brief introduction to classification methods and classification framework
  Model Evaluation Measures
  Parameters chosen during implementation and why
  Conclusion on whether ensemble method improves performance of the basic classification method you chose, why or why no
  
  
You can run either decision tree or random forest on the various sets of data with one of:

python RandomForest.py train_file test_file
OR
python DecisionTree.py train_file test_file
