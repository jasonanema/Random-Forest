# Random-Forest
This repository contains python code for a decision tree and a random forest classifier which I wrote from scratch as a project
in a Data Mining course I took at UIUC in Fall 2017 (CS 412). I wrote these to work on the type of data sets that are shared in this file
(note that there are both testing and training data sets for each).

Used Python version 2.7.6 and only used built-in libraries (datetime, random, sys).

Read report.pdf for details, such as:
  Brief introduction to classification methods and classification framework
  Model Evaluation Measures
  Parameters chosen during implementation and why
  Conclusion on whether ensemble method improves performance of the basic classification method you chose, why or why not
  
Near the top of each .py file, you can comment/uncomment the 'with open' commands to run the programs on the various testing and training 
data sets.
